Winder/Unwinder - Next steps
 
Pre-requisites
- Contact Nilesh to understand the needs expressed by IC&D/Drives MKT > Albin
- Contact PY PARICHAULT (expert) to understand customer pain-points > Hugues
- Analyze solutions and performance from our competitors > Jaouher
 
Approach
1. Basic system test
- Model-based-design: build physical model
- interface physical model with controller code (Control Expert)
- interface drive with controller
 
2. Optimize system
- Model-based-design: validate physical model vs real-life machine
- update ATV dPAC controller code implementation (to align with Control Expert), to update functionality
- improve drive fw, to optimize performance
 
Challenges
- how to validate the simulation vs real-life machine? talk to customer (Sylvamo) to help?
- is it possible to address current customer pain-points?
- is possible to align/exceed competitors features/performance?
- is it possible to provide a better solution/performance than competitors? (less sensors, ...)
